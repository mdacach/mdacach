#### Hi, I hope this message finds you well!

# Introduction

I am Matheus, a Software Engineer specializing in Algorithms and Data Structures.
I've chosen not to continue pursuing my college degree and have been self-learning Computer Science for around 4 years now. At
the start, I've fallen in love
with online courses on edX, Coursera, and MIT OCW. Then, I discovered Competitive Programming and put a lot of
effort into that. And for the last year, I've been working for an international micro startup with a very ambitious
(and complex) project using modern C++. It is a lot of fun! Below I go on a bit deeper into my experiences. Enjoy!

# Software Engineering

I've been working for a micro startup with a very ambitious project for the past year. Please refer to
my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-cardoso-dev/)
for the most up-to-date information about my work. Please note that our repository is private, so my work there is not
here
on GitHub.

# Projects

## [Prefix Tree](https://github.com/mdacach/prefix_tree)
This is a data structure commonly used for Strings in Competitive Programming that I saw fit to our application at work. It performed much better than our previous solution. More information is found on the repo. I would love suggestions too!

## Learning Rust
I've been amazed by the language and I aim to become an excellent Rust programmer.
I am learning Rust primarily through books (there are many great ones!) and putting the skills learned in action through my project below.

### [Automating script for incremental game](https://github.com/mdacach/ngu_script_rust)
This is a script for automating the gameplay of an [incremental game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game).
It gives me the opportunity of going deeper in the environment and practice my Rust skills. It's under active development.

## [Design Patterns (Java -> C++)](https://github.com/mdacach/head_first_design_patterns_cpp)
I am currently learning Design Patterns by going through the great
book [Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124)
(in Java) and porting it to my current stack, C++. Please note it is a work in
progress.
Relevant resources for this project are

* [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) which I've found to be an amazing refresher on C++ topics
* [mrlegowatch's repository](https://github.com/mrlegowatch/HeadFirstDesignPatternsCpp), which was also porting the
  examples in Java to be C++, but is unfortunately incomplete.
 
## [Concurrency (Java)](https://github.com/mdacach/autonomous_driving)
This is an old University Assignment on Concurrency. Multiple cars go through shared sections of a road.

## [Web Development with Go (Let's Go Book by Alex Edwards)](https://github.com/mdacach/lets_go_web_development)
I have also started studying Go, for Web Development. I followed [this book](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) by Alex Edwards, but did not complete it
due to not liking the Web Development area as much as Systems Programming. I did like GoLang as a language though, and will keep studying it.

## Future Projects
Topics for the near-future:

* Test-Driven Design,
  with [Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development: Code Better, Sleep Better](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Programming-Test-Driven-Development-Better/dp/1937785483)
* System Design
  with [System Design Interview â€“ An insider's guide](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/ref=pd_sbs_sccl_1/137-0417816-8881332?pd_rd_w=M4unz&pf_rd_p=3676f086-9496-4fd7-8490-77cf7f43f846&pf_rd_r=9E8EYTQ7PQVFK7WSMBWZ&pd_rd_r=c604fbc0-1703-4d0b-b831-ef54d7ddbdc0&pd_rd_wg=NmQk5&pd_rd_i=B08CMF2CQF&psc=1)
* Computer Systems
  with [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-Global-ebook/dp/B07V71PHR7/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=csapp&qid=1650239425&sr=8-2)
* and the
  famous [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)
  
# Freelancing

My first work experience was through Freelancing. I am currently Top Rated Plus on Upwork, with 100%
Job Success Score and 5-star feedback. I have taken projects that include:

* Software Engineering assignments in multiple languages
* Hard algorithmic problems
* Algorithmic training
* Production-ready C++ development

With a special mention to Coding Interview Preparation, where I've done more than 40 hour-sessions preparing a mentee
for "Big Tech" Coding Interviews.

# Competitive Programming

I've found Competitive Programming to be a great (and fun) exercise, having poured many hours into it. I regularly
compete on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/matheusdacach)
where I currently have 1729 rating (Expert), with more than 1200 problems solved. I've learned a great deal of
interesting ideas in Computer Science and have honed my Problem-Solving skills due to
the competitions.

All in all, I think Competitive Programming is much more beneficial than it first seems, and that's
why I've chosen to focus on it for so long. But it also comes with downfalls:
in competitions, we must strive to pass the solutions in the least coding time possible, so not a lot of consideration
is given
to write clean, maintainable, and readable code, which required a change of perspective
when writing production-ready code for my current job.

All my submissions are public on Codeforces, but I do not recommend going through them. I also have plans to push
solutions
to [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) and my individual library of Algorithms and Data Structures
implementations for competitions, but it is a work in progress.

# Online Courses

My first self-learning experience was with Online Courses. Top-tier universities provide quality courses for free, on
platforms such as [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/)
.
They also usually come with an "audit" option, where you can go over the courses resources (sometimes even the exams!)
but without the Certificate
of
Completion. That was what I did, as the certificates were too expensive at the time.

Courses that I've audited, in no particular order:

* [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
* [Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift)
* [Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java)
* [Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines)
* Princeton's [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
* MIT OCW Gilbert Strang's [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)
* [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)
* [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-4)
* [Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data)

Honorable mentions to:

* [Fundamentals of Statistics](https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-of-statistics), which I've
  attempted
  to go through
  when pursuing Data Science and ML, but it was way too hard for me at the time, haha
* [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) MIT's Playlist
  on
  Youtube, which I've watched
  a good amount because of Competitive Programming, but didn't attempt any exam or exercise.
