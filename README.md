### Hi, hope this message finds you well!

### Introduction

I am Matheus, a Software Engineer specialized in Algorithms and Data Structures.
I've been learning Computer Science for around 4 years now. At the start, I've fallen in love
with online courses on edX, Coursera and MIT OCW. Then, I've discovered Competitive Programming and put in a lot of
effort into that. And for the last year, I've been working for an international micro start-up with a very ambitious
(and complex) project. It is a lot of fun! Below I got a bit deeper into my experiences. Enjoy!

### Online Courses

Top-tier universities provide quality courses for free, on platforms such as [edX](https://www.edx.org/)
, [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/).
They also usually come with an "audit" option, where you can go over the courses resources but without the certificate
of
completion. That was what I did, as the certificates were too expensive at the time.

Courses that I've audited, in no particular order:

* [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
* [Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift)
* [Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java)
* [Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines)
* Princeton's [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
* MIT OCW Gilbert Strang's [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)
* [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)
* [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-4)
* [Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data)

Honor's mentions to: 

* [Fundamentals of Statistics](https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-of-statistics) which I've
attempted
to go through
when pursuing Data Science and ML, but was way too hard for me at the time haha
* [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) MIT Playlist on Youtube, which I've watched
a good amount because of Competitive Programming, but didn't attempt any exam or exercise.
