Hey! I am a Systems Software Engineer, particularly interested in Computer Science fundamentals and Rust.
Check out my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-cardoso-dev/) for more professional information.

I have started my professional career with C++17, and then (thankfully ðŸ˜†) moved to Rust programming. Rust is my first language of choice nowadays :crab:

I currently work at [Ditto](https://www.ditto.com/) in the data synchronization protocol that enables edge devices to synchronize data peer-to-peer with dynamic subscriptions. The work covers distributed systems design, highly concurrent async Rust, lightweight formal methods and more. It's great and I love my team.

I have a background on Competitive Programming from university days, meaning that I am a big fan of Algorithms and Data Structures, and most recently I've been studying Operating Systems (through [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)) and Database Systems (through [Andy Pavlo's CMU lectures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjYDBpQnSymaectKjxCy6BYq&si=UGoqo_yJ9rZcT9Uw)).

I am also a big fan of [Brandon Sanderson's writing](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/the-stormlight-archive-series), and am currently enjoying struggling (weird, right?) on [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/). Might dethrone [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) as my favorite game ever.

Happy to talk more ðŸ˜„
