#### Hi, I hope this message finds you well!

### Introduction

I am Matheus, a Software Engineer specialized in Algorithms and Data Structures.
I've chosen to not continue pursuing my Degree, and have been self-learning Computer Science for around 4 years now. At
the start, I've fallen in love
with online courses on edX, Coursera and MIT OCW. Then, I've discovered Competitive Programming and put in a lot of
effort into that. And for the last year, I've been working for an international micro start-up with a very ambitious
(and complex) project, using modern C++. It is a lot of fun! Below I go on a bit deeper into my experiences. Enjoy!

### Online Courses

My first self-learning experience was with Online Courses. Top-tier universities provide quality courses for free, on
platforms such as [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/)
.
They also usually come with an "audit" option, where you can go over the courses resources (sometimes even the exams!)
but without the Certificate
of
Completion. That was what I did, as the certificates were too expensive at the time.

Courses that I've audited, in no particular order:

* [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
* [Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift)
* [Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java)
* [Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines)
* Princeton's [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
* MIT OCW Gilbert Strang's [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)
* [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)
* [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-4)
* [Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data)

Honorable mentions to:

* [Fundamentals of Statistics](https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-of-statistics) which I've
  attempted
  to go through
  when pursuing Data Science and ML, but was way too hard for me at the time haha
* [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) MIT's Playlist
  on
  Youtube, which I've watched
  a good amount because of Competitive Programming, but didn't attempt any exam or exercise.

### Competitive Programming

I've found Competitive Programming to be a great (and fun) exercise, having poured a lot of hours into it. I regularly
compete on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/matheusdacach)
where I have currently 1729 (Expert) rating, with more than 1200 problems solved. I've learned a great deal of
interesting ideas in Computer Science and have honed my Problem-Solving skills due to
the competitions.

All in all, I think Competitive Programming is much more beneficial than it first seems, and that's
why I've chosen to focus on it for so long. That being said, it also comes with downfalls:
in competitions, we must strive to pass the solutions in the least coding time possible, so not a lot of consideration
is given
to write clean, maintainable and readable code, which required a change of perspective
when writing production-ready code, for my current job.

All my submissions are public on Codeforces, but I do not recommend going through them. I also have plans to push
solutions
to [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) and my individual library of Algorithms and Data Structures
implementations for competitions, but it is a work in progress.

### Freelancing

My first work experience was through Freelancing. I am currently Top Rated Plus on Upwork, with 100%
Job Success Score and 5-star feedbacks. I have taken projects that include:

* Software Engineering assignments on multiple languages
* Hard algorithmic problems
* Algorithmic training
* Production-ready C++ development

With a special mention to Coding Interview Preparation, where I've done more than 40 hour-sessions preparing a mentee
for "Big Tech" Coding Interviews.

### Software Engineering

For the past year, I've been working for a micro startup with a very ambitious project. Please refer to
my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-cardoso-dev/)
for the most up-to-date information about my work. Please note that our repository is private, so my work there is not
here
on GitHub. Also note that most of my code here is old.

### Current Learning Projects

I am currently learning Design Patterns by going through the great
book [Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124)
(in Java) and porting it to my current stack, C++. You can check the work in
progress [here](https://github.com/mdacach/head_first_design_patterns_cpp).
Relevant resources for this project are

* [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) which I've found to be a very nice refresher on C++ topics
* [mrlegowatch's repository](https://github.com/mrlegowatch/HeadFirstDesignPatternsCpp) which was also porting the
  examples in Java to be C++, but is unfortunately incomplete.

Topics for the near-future are:

* Test-Driven Design,
  with [Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development: Code Better, Sleep Better](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Programming-Test-Driven-Development-Better/dp/1937785483)
* System Design
  with [System Design Interview â€“ An insider's guide](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/ref=pd_sbs_sccl_1/137-0417816-8881332?pd_rd_w=M4unz&pf_rd_p=3676f086-9496-4fd7-8490-77cf7f43f846&pf_rd_r=9E8EYTQ7PQVFK7WSMBWZ&pd_rd_r=c604fbc0-1703-4d0b-b831-ef54d7ddbdc0&pd_rd_wg=NmQk5&pd_rd_i=B08CMF2CQF&psc=1)
* Computer Systems
  with [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-Global-ebook/dp/B07V71PHR7/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=csapp&qid=1650239425&sr=8-2)
* and the
  famous [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)

TODO:
* Maybe discuss further my work experience
* Overview of past projects
