# Introduction

I am a Backend Software Engineer with strong Computer Science knowledge looking for a new remote role.  
I am particularly good with Algorithms and Data Structures, having competed in [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) twice.  
Please look at my highlighted projects below.

# Professional Experience

I have professional experience in Systems Programming with Modern C++.  
Please refer to my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-cardoso-dev/)
for detailed information.

# Projects

## [Systems Programming] [Remote File Synchronization in Rust](https://github.com/mdacach/rsync_rust)
`rsync` algorithm implementation from [Andrew Tridgell's Ph.D. thesis](https://www.samba.org/~tridge/phd_thesis.pdf).  

* Data Structures and Algorithms - [Rolling Hash](https://github.com/mdacach/rolling_hash_rust).
* Extensive Testing - Unit, End to End, Property-based.
* Continuous Integration - GitHub Actions.
* Benchmarking and Data Analysis.

## [Backend Development] [Email Newsletter in Rust](https://github.com/mdacach/newsletter)
Cloud-native, fault-tolerant Email newsletter built in Rust.

* Asynchronous Programming.
* Databases - PostgreSQL and Redis.
* Docker - Image Size and Build Speed optimization.
* Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) - GitHub Actions and Fly.io.
* Telemetry, Observability and Instrumentation.
* Zero-Downtime Deployment.
* actix-web, sqlx, tokio, tracing, config, secrecy.


## [Multi-threaded TCP Proxy in Rust](https://gitfront.io/r/mdacach/wkTQKZ8MHYtm/rust-networking-proxy/)  
Simple line-oriented TCP Proxy written in Rust.  

* Networking Protocols.
* Asynchronous Programming.
* Multi-threaded Programming.
* serde, tokio.

## [Rolling Hash File Sync in C++](https://github.com/mdacach/rolling_hash_file_diff)
`rsync` algorithm implementation, now in C++.

## [Prefix Tree in C++](https://github.com/mdacach/prefix_tree)
This is a data structure commonly used for Strings in Competitive Programming that I saw fit to our application at work. It performed much better than our previous solution. More information is found on the repository.
 
## [Concurrency (Java)](https://github.com/mdacach/autonomous_driving)
This is an old University Assignment on Concurrency. Multiple cars go through shared sections of a road.

# Freelancing

My first work experience was through Freelancing. I am Top Rated Plus on Upwork, with 100%
Job Success Score and 5-star feedback. I have also trained a client for "Big Tech" coding interviews,
including problem-solving techniques, specific algorithms and data structures, and interview preparation.

# Competitive Programming

I have regularly practiced Competitive Programming for mostly two years.  
[I am currently rated "Expert", with 1729 rating](https://codeforces.com/profile/matheusdacach), and more than 1400 problems solved.   
I have also been a nationals finalist for ICPC twice, the two times I have participated.  

# Online Courses

My first self-learning experience was with Online Courses. Top-tier universities provide quality courses for free, on
platforms such as [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/)
.
They also usually come with an "audit" option, where you can go over the courses resources (sometimes even the exams!)
but without the Certificate
of
Completion. That was what I did, as the certificates were too expensive at the time.

Courses that I've audited, in no particular order:

* [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
* [Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift)
* [Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java)
* [Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines)
* Princeton's [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
* MIT OCW Gilbert Strang's [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)
* [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)
* [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-4)
* [Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data)

Honorable mentions to:

* [Fundamentals of Statistics](https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-of-statistics), which I've
  attempted
  to go through
  when pursuing Data Science and ML, but it was way too hard for me at the time, haha
* [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) MIT's Playlist
  on
  Youtube, which I've watched
  a good amount because of Competitive Programming, but didn't attempt any exam or exercise.
